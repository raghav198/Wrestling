Wrestling Application
===
Authored by Raghav Malik

Usage
-----
At this point this is a simple console-based program. The names
of the players are hard-coded in (but there will soon be database functionality)
When the driver class is run, the application prompts the user to enter the 
winner of each match displayed on the screen, based on which future matches
are then calculated. When all the necessary matches have been played out, the
program displays the top 5 wrestlers who advance to the next level, as well as their
positions.

Features
--------

<h3>Database</h3>
The database connection is completely set up and the database is populated with some fake data to ensure that the program works. Therefore the player strings need no longer be hard-coded into the program. This feature can be found under the 'Database' branch.

<h3>Multiple Weight Classes</h3>
Currently the program only supports having a single weight-class running but this is an extremely easy feature to extend and will not require a separate branch.

<h3>Graphics</h3>
At  this point the program is entirely console based. A graphical interface is present in its future, but this is not likely to be implemented in the next few days. This feature will be created on a separate branch.
