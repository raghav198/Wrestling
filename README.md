Wrestling Application

At this point this is a simple console-based program. The names
of the players are hard-coded in (but there will soon be database functionality)
When the driver class is run, the application prompts the user to enter the 
winner of each match displayed on the screen, based on which future matches
are then calculated. When all the necessary matches have been played out, the
program displays the top 5 wrestlers who advance to the next level, as well as their
positions.
